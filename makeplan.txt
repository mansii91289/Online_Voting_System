3. vote one of the candidate, after voting, user can't vote again
4. there is a route which shows the list of candidates and their live vote counts sorted by their vote count
5. user data must contain their one unique government id proof named : aadhar card number
6. there should be one admin who can only maintain the table of candidates and he acn't be able to vote at all
